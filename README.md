# Route-Tracker
An iOS app that lets you snapshot/record your location history. (Kinda like the Google Maps feature, but with Apple's MapKit)

### Features
- Take a snapshot or start recording anytime anywhere!
- Get a minute-by-minute detail of your location history as routes on the map.
- Export previous location to Apple Maps/Other third party apps

### Technical
- Uses Swift, Apple's UIKit and MapKit for the User Interface
- Firebase Auth for authentication and user account CRUD
- Firebase Firestore to store location history (in a complex collection-document format)
