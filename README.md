# Route-Tracker
An iOS app that lets you record/snapshot your location history. (Kinda like the Google Maps feature, but with Apple's MapKit)

### Demo


### Features
- Start recording or take a snapshot anytime anywhere!
- Get a periodic detail (customizable) of your location history as routes on the map.
- Export previous location to Apple Maps/Other third party apps

### Technical
- Uses Swift, Apple's UIKit and MapKit for the User Interface
- Firebase Auth for authentication and user account CRUD
- Firebase Firestore to store location history (in a 3-tiered collection-document format)
